# Developer Note

When developing the database queries, please put a comment at the top of the file to indicate the **purpose** of the query, **how it works**, **inputs**, **outputs/expected results**. This will help streamline the development process and ensure we don't forget how our code works. :)

All the database queries can be viewed here: <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1khOIhWv6MfOnDU_hCHNSzwk2T4RD_K9_AH2XeMJr1zQ/edit>
