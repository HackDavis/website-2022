# Summary

This folder is used to store page components which represents a section on the landing page or any other pages/sections we will be creating in the future. Ideally, each page component will be used to consolidate individual components we have created in the components folder.

## Developer Note

In this folder, the **DBTest.js** page contains a collection of buttons to test out the backend database queries. This page will be beneficial when you want to test out any newly developed database queries (most likely wouldn't need to unless we missed something) or existing queries.
