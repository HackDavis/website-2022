          With the rapid advancement of technology, it is important to use its
          power in ways that benefit society. HackDavis challenges its
          participants to hack for social good, and create an opportunity for us
          to explore the intersection between technology and society.
          <br /> <br />
          On January 16-17, over 700 students, hackers, and creators came
          together virtually for 36 hours of hacking. For the 6th year in a row,
          we brought the most talented students in California (and beyond!) to
          address the worldâ€™s most pressing issues.
